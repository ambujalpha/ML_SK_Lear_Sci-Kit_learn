# ML_SK_Lear_Sci-Kit_learn
A repository where you can explore various machine learning model using Sc-Kit(SK) learn library
Data Set for each model is given you can edit ir, comments are placed for better understanding.
Data Set can be easily replaced by yours can you can obtain the result by simply running file into juypter or copy the code and run on any platform.


**Model1**- Simple_linear_Regression
        You can understand it by comments in the file
        
        
**Model2**- Multiple_linear_Regression

        It has been performed by poor data set, so first performed **PREPROCESSING** and **Data_cleaning** by
        Exploring the descriptive statistics of the variables
        Determining the variables of interest
        Dealing with missing values
        Exploring the PDFs
        Dealing with outliers
        Checking the OLS assumptions
        Relaxing the assumptions
        Multicollinearity
        Create dummy variables
        Rearrange a bit
        Then for **Linear Regression Model** we performed
        Declare the inputs and the targets
        Scale the data
        Train Test Split
        Create the regression
        Finding the weights and bias
        Finally we performed **Testing**
